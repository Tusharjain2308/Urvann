# AI-Powered Meeting Notes Summarizer

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an **AI-powered meeting notes summarizer and sharer**, built as a **full-stack MERN project**.  
The goal is to allow users to **upload a transcript (text/PDF)** and provide a **custom instruction or prompt** (e.g., *"Summarize in bullet points for executives"* or *"Highlight only action items"*).  

After clicking **Generate Summary**, the system calls the **Gemini API** to generate a structured summary as per the user’s instruction.  
You can then **edit the generated summary** directly in the interface and **share it via email with a single click**.
